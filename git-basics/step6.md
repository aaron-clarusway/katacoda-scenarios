# Cloning

The cloning command is awesome, not only does it get the repository, it also sets up the remote tracking for all of the branches. We are going to use the clone command to get our newly forked repo:

`git clone https://github.com/clarusway/IT-Fundamentals-2-20-Class-Notes.git`{{execute}}

`cd katacoda-tutorial`{{execute}}

#### Syntax
Local: `git clone /path/to/repository`

Remote: `git clone username@host:/path/to/repository`
